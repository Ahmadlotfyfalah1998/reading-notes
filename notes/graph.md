A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.<br>
### Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.<br>
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.<br>
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.<br>
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.<br>
## Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.<br>
## Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.<br>
Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.<br>
## Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
## Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
## Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
## Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
## Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.<br>

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.<br>
## Graph Representation
We represent graphs through:<br>

- Adjacency Matrix<br>
- Adjacency List<br>
