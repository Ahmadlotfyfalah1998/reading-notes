## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?
1. First, Restate the Question<br>
2. Ask About Edge Cases<br>
3. Ask About Test Cases<br>
4. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense<br>
5. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good<br>
6. Stuck? Ask for Help!<br>

## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve yourperformance during a whiteboard programming interview?
#### 1) Take a few minutes.
Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews.<br>
 The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook,<br>
 however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking,<br>
 passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.<br>

#### 3) Write down the steps of the solution.
Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down.<br>
 Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.<br>
You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.<br>
## What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?
Technical Knowledge: Brush up on fundamental data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques commonly asked during coding interviews.<br>
Practice solving a wide range of coding problems from easy to complex.<br>

Problem-Solving Skills: Improve your ability to think critically and analytically. Work on breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.<br>

Mock Interviews: Practice with mock interviews to simulate the real interview environment.<br>
This will help you get comfortable with the process and identify areas where you can improve.<br>

Communication Skills: Be able to articulate your thought process clearly. <br>
Interviewers not only look for correct answers but also the ability to explain your approach and reasoning effectively.<br>

Behavioral Preparation: Don't overlook behavioral interviews. Be ready to answer questions about your experience, projects you've worked on, <br>
and how you handle various situations.<br>
