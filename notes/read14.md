## Q1.
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile and widely-used library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.<br> It provides a wide range of plotting functions and supports various plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc. 
Seaborn: Seaborn is a high-level statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.<br> It provides a simplified interface and offers a set of aesthetic enhancements to create visually appealing statistical graphics.<br> Seaborn is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis and for creating complex plots with minimal code.
Bokeh: Bokeh is a library specifically designed for interactive visualizations and targets modern web browsers. <br>It allows you to create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
## Q2.
sns.scatterplot(): Creates a scatter plot to show the relationship between two numerical variables. <br>
sns.lineplot(): Plots a line plot to visualize the trend or relationship between two numerical variables.<br>
sns.relplot(): Creates a relational plot that can be customized to show various types of relationships using different plot types, such as scatter plots, line plots, or categorical plots.<br>
sns.barplot(): Plots a bar chart to compare values of a categorical variable.<br>
sns.countplot(): Displays the count of observations in each category of a categorical variable using bars.<br>
sns.boxplot(): Creates a box plot to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable for each category in a categorical variable.<br>
sns.violinplot(): Combines a box plot with a kernel density estimation plot to represent the distribution of a numerical variable for each category.<br>
sns.histplot(): Plots a histogram to visualize the distribution of a single variable.<br>
sns.kdeplot(): Displays the kernel density estimate of a single variable, providing a smooth representation of the distribution.<br>
sns.distplot(): Deprecated in recent versions of Seaborn. Use sns.histplot() or sns.kdeplot() instead.<br>
sns.jointplot(): Creates a joint plot to show the distribution of two variables along with their individual distributions.<br>
sns.pairplot(): Generates a grid of scatter plots or other visualizations for each pair of numerical variables in a dataset.<br>
## Q3.
The Seaborn Cheat Sheet is a helpful resource that provides a concise summary of the main functions and capabilities of the Seaborn library.<br> It serves as a quick reference guide for Python developers working with Seaborn,<br> allowing them to easily access and recall the syntax and usage of different functions.
