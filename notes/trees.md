A Tree is a Data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner.<br> 
Each Tree consists of a root node from which we can access each element of the tree. <br>
Starting from the root node, each node contains zero or more nodes connected to it as children. <br>
A simple binary tree can be depicted as seen in the following figure.<br>
A tree consists of a root node, leaf nodes and internal nodes. Each node is connected to its chile via a reference, which is called an edge. <br>
#### Root Node:
Root node is the topmost node of a tree. It is always the first node created while creating the tree and we can access each element of the tree starting from the root node.<br>
In the above example, the node containing element 50 is the root node.<br>
#### Parent Node: 
The parent of any node is the node which references the current node.<br>
#### Child Node:
Child nodes of a parent node are the nodes at which the parent node is pointing using the references.<br>
#### Edge:
The reference through which a parent node is connected to a child node is called an edge.<br>
#### Leaf Node:
These are those nodes in the tree which have no children. <br>
#### Internal Nodes:
Internal Nodes are the nodes which have at least one child.<br>
### What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have a maximum of 2 children. <br>
It means that each node in a binary tree can have either one, or two or no children.<br>
Each node in a binary tree contains data and references to its children.<br>
Both the children are named as left child and the right child according to their position. <br>
