A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.<br>
Common terminology for a stack is<br>
Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed<br>
Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>
Top - This is the top of the stack.<br>
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>
IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.<br>
Stacks follow these concepts:<br>
FILO<br>
First In Last Out<br>
LIFO<br>
Last In First Out<br>
Common terminology for a queue is<br>

Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.<br>
Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.<br>
Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.<br>
Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.<br>
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.<br>
IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.<br>
Queues follow these concepts:<br>

FIFO<br>
First In First Out<br>



LILO<br>
Last In Last Out<br>
