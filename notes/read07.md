# Q1.
In Python, variable scope determines where in the program a variable is accessible and where it can be modified. The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is defined and can be accessed.

Python has two types of variable scopes: local and global.

Local scope refers to variables that are defined within a function or a code block. These variables are only accessible within the block or function where they are defined. They cannot be accessed outside of that block or function.

Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function or block. These variables are accessible throughout the entire program, including inside functions and blocks.
# Q2.
In Python, global and nonlocal are keywords that allow us to modify variables in the outer scopes from within a nested scope. These keywords are used when we need to access or modify variables that are not in the local scope of a function or block.
# Q3.
we have to write the big O in algorithm to discripe the the prossecc of the code and explame how it work and how much time needed to to the work.
# Q4.
in oython we import a random library and deal with some methods like random() ,choice() , randint() ,for a dice we use randint() and give it range from 1 to 6 and this method will return a random number between 1 and 6
