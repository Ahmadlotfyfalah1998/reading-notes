# Q1 .<br>
1.If you want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a python list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc, you can use the random module in python. You can also use the random module to create random strings while choosing passwords to make your password database more secure or power a random page feature of your website.
<br>
2.The Random module contains some very useful functions namely randint() function, random() function, choice() function, randrange() function and shuffle() function. Let us discuss each of these functions one by one.

# Q2.<br>
The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.
<br>
There are three steps:<br>

1.Searching the risk<br>
2.Analyzing the impact of each individual risk<br>
3.Measures for the risk identified<br>
# Q3.<br>
Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken.

In simple terms, it is a technique to ensure that your tests are testing your code or how much of your code you exercised by running the test.
# Q4.<br>
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,[1] Edmund Landau,[2] and others, collectively called Bachmannâ€“Landau notation or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation.
