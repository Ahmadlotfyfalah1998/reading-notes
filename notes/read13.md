# Q1.
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.<br>
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable.<br>
The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
# Q2.
How to Create a Sklearn Linear Regression Model.<br>
Step 1: Importing All the Required Libraries.<br>
Step 2: Reading the Dataset. <br>
Step 3: Exploring the Data Scatter.<br> 
Step 4: Data Cleaning. <br>
Step 5: Training Our Model.<br> 
Step 6: Exploring Our Results. <br>
Step 7: Working With a Smaller Dataset.<br>
# Q3.
### Why do we need train and test samples
A very common issue when training a model is overfitting. This phenomenon occurs when a model performs really well on the data that we used to train it but it fails to generalise well to new, unseen data points.
## Things I want to know more about
1.linear Regression <br>
2. splitting the dataset into train and test sets
