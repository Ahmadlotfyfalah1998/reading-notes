# Q1. What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?
Basic Docker Components:<BR>
Docker Client: The first component of Docker is the client, which allows the users to communicate with Docker.<BR>
Being a client-server architecture, Docker can connect to the host remotely and locally.<BR>
Docker Image: Docker images are used to build containers and hold the entire metadata that elaborates the capabilities of the container.<BR>
Docker Daemon: Docker Daemon is among the most essential components of Docker as it is directly responsible for fulfilling the actions related to containers.<BR>
Docker Networking: As the name suggests, Docker networking is the component that helps in establishing communication between containers. <BR>
Docker Registry: Docker images require a location where they can be stored and the Docker registry is that location.<BR>
Docker Container: A Docker container is the instance of an image that can be created, started, moved, or deleted through a Docker API.<BR>

Step 4: Create views for the library management system<BR>

# Q3. Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?
Django is a web framework for building web applications with the Python programming language.<BR>
It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and encourages the use of reusable code.<BR>
Django has built-in support for handling forms, authentication, and other common functionality required for web applications.<BR>
Django REST framework, on the other hand, is a set of tools for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using the Django framework.<BR>
It provides a simple and consistent way to build and test APIs, and includes support for authentication, permissioning, pagination, <BR>
and other features commonly needed in API development.<BR>
While Django is focused on building web applications, Django REST framework is focused on building APIs that can be consumed by other applications.<BR>
