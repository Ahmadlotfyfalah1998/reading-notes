# Q1.
Jupyter Lab is an interactive development environment that provides a flexible and powerful environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks,<br>
code files, and other data science tools.<br>
It builds upon the functionality of Jupyter Notebook but offers several key features and benefits that distinguish it from the traditional notebook interface.

# Q2.
1. Multi-dimensional arrays<br>
2. Element-wise operation<br>
3. Broadcasting<br>
4. Vectorized operations<br>
5. Efficient array operations<br>
6. Mathematical functions<br>
7. Integration with other libraries<br>
# Q3.
The basic structure of a NumPy array is the ndarray object, which represents a multi-dimensional, homogeneous array of fixed-size items<br>
properties:<br>
1. Shape<br>
2. Data Type<br>
## Things I want to know more about
