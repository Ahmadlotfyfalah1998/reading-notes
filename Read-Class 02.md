## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
1.Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
examples
1. The freela
2. Baby Steps
3. The Cycle
## If name equals main
the condition if __name__ == “__main__” 
will do the functions if the python file is script 
and will not run it if it's a module
 ### Advantages 
 1. Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
 2. If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
 3. Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
 4. if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported
## Recursion
Recursion is a function can call and repete it's self until it find a base case 
# Reading Questions
#### Q1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python follows key principles: write a test, run the test which should fail, write code to pass the test, and then run all tests. TDD improves code coverage, promotes simpler design, prevents regressions,  and serves as documentation. By following these principles, developers create higher quality code with fewer bugs and easier collaboration.
#### Q2. according to my understanding it will execute the functions if the python file is  script and if it imported as module will not execute it
#### Q3. it is a function that will call it self many times until it reach to some thing called (base case) , the base case is a condition that will return from  the function
a value than the function will stop calling its self
#### Q4. the module is a code that writen in another page and we can import it or import a functions from it in the main page 
the packege is a group of moudles and we can import it in a main page 

## Things I want to know more about
1. moudles and packages 
2.  recursion functions 
3. Unit tests
