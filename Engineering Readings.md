 ### Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000
what will you do ?
you will waste your time on same activities? and spend your time watching television and social media when you should be productive and effective.
Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.
if you know that your time is valuable 
1.  People will recognize that
2.  People will respect that
3.  People will treat you differently

If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken
How do you value your time?

Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?

How many activities were a true waste of time?

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in
