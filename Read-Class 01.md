# Q1. 
### 1. new languge => new syntax => new erorrs 
 #### so the new paython student will deal with different languge and he will face a different erorrs
### 2. new python student have no enough experience in pyhton methods , data types and syntax 
# two strategies for overcoming these challenges
#### 1. watch a lot of python tutorials and vedios 
#### 2. try to do small projects on python languge and solve problem and error in the project to increase the experience 
# Q2. 
 ### 1. Time complexity is defined in terms of how many times it takes to run a given algorithm
 ### 2. Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space needed the algorithm in its life cycle
 # Q3. In programming, you have an immutable object if you can’t change the object’s state after you’ve created it. In contrast, a mutable object allows you to modify its internal state after creation. In short, whether you’re able to change an object’s state or contained data is what defines if that object is mutable or immutable
