### 1.Big O notation : is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function.
<br> 
efficiency  based on 2 factors:
<br>
 1.Running Time:The amount of time a function needs to complete.
 <br>
2.Memory Space:The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.<br>

### 4 Key Areas for analysis
1.Input Size <br>
2.Units of Measurement <br>
3.Orders of Growth <br>
4.Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case <br>

### 2.A Linked List : a data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
#### two types of Linked List
1.Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.<br>
2.Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.<br>

### data structures:  are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects 
## linear data structures:  means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed 

 Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially
 
### The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures
 
 Some external factors affect the time it takes for a function to run: the speed of the processor, what else the computer is running, etc. So it’s hard to make strong statements about the exact runtime of an algorithm. Instead we use big O notation to express how quickly its runtime grows
