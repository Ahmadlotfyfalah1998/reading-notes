# Data Structures and Algorithms

# 1. Recursion 
  Recursion :is a function that call it's self until it reach to a specific condition 
  we can use  the Recursion to find summation and factorial for example in easier ways 
# 2. Data Structures
Data Structures are the ways to store and orgnaize the data inside computer memory (according to my understanding)
some types of Data Structures
### 1. Arrays
An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers .
### 2. Linked Lists 
A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other.
### 3. Stacks 
A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.
### 4. Queues
A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.
### 5. Hash Tables
A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them.
### 6. Trees
A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together.
### 7. Heaps
A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.
### 8. Graphs
A graph G is said to be an undirected graph if all its edges have no direction.

# 3. big O
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

# Discussion Questions
 1. It is important to state that no single data structure serves as an optimal solution for all problems. With that in mind, to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed. Then, we need to choose the data structure that delivers the best performance trade-off over the tasks we have to accomplish.
 2. by adding a condition that  return from the function a specific value this called (base case)
## Things I want to know more about
1. big O
2. graph data structure 
3. diffrents between Data Structures
